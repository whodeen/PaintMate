# PaintMate
[AVRspot] Test task

Summary

What was done:
• Draw on image
• Change brush size
• Change brush color
• Save image in png format

Problems I have faced with: 
• Due to Unity bug with slider there is an additional
method to change it.

Not solved:
• Open/Load file dialog works only in editor mode;
• Change brush type
• Standalone (PC, Mac) and mobile (iOS, Android compatible) are not supported.
